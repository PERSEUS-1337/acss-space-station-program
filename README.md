# Weather Data Gathering Program

This program is designed to gather weather information from Earth by utilizing existing satellites orbiting the planet. The program is meant to be run on a space station, where it will be able to collect data from the satellites and store it for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Additionally, you will need to have an active internet connection to retrieve weather data from the satellites.

## Installation

To install the program, simply download the files from the GitHub repository and save them to your local machine. There is no need to install any additional libraries or dependencies.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the main.py file using the command:

`python main.py`

The program will automatically connect to the available satellites and retrieve weather data from them. The data will be stored in a local file for later analysis.

# Space Station Data Encryption

This is a collection of Python scripts that handles encryption of data being used on the space station. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the scripts to encrypt your data.

## Usage

To encrypt a file, run the `encrypt.py` script and pass in the file path as an argument:

`python encrypt.py path/to/file`

To decrypt a file, run the `decrypt.py` script and pass in the file path as an argument:

`python decrypt.py path/to/file`

**Note:** The key used for encryption and decryption is generated automatically and stored in the `key.key` file. Make sure to keep this file secure as it is required to decrypt the data.

`python decrypt.py path/to/file`

**Note:** The key used for encryption and decryption is generated automatically and stored in the `key.key` file. Make sure to keep this file secure as it is required to decrypt the data.
