# Weather Data Gathering Program

This program is designed to gather weather information from Earth by utilizing existing satellites orbiting the planet. The program is meant to be run on a space station, where it will be able to collect data from the satellites and store it for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Additionally, you will need to have an active internet connection to retrieve weather data from the satellites.

## Installation

To install the program, simply download the files from the GitHub repository and save them to your local machine. There is no need to install any additional libraries or dependencies.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the main.py file using the command:

`python main.py`

The program will automatically connect to the available satellites and retrieve weather data from them. The data will be stored in a local file for later analysis.
